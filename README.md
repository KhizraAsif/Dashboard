*Objective:
          To analyze customer orders dataset and prepare it for further business insights by cleaning, converting datatypes, and making it ready for analysis.

*Problem Statement:
                The dataset contains customer, product, and order details. Some columns have incorrect datatypes (like dates stored as text or sales stored as integer). This can cause issues in analysis and visualization. The task is to correct datatypes and ensure the data is clean.

**Results:
.Converted Order.Date and Ship.Date into proper datetime format.
.Converted Sales into float for accuracy in calculations.
.Ignored unnecessary warnings for a clean workflow.
.Verified datatypes after transformation.

**Final Insights:
.The dataset is now properly cleaned and structured.
.Dates can be used for time-series analysis (e.g., sales trend by month/week).
.Sales, Profit, and Shipping cost are in numeric format, so financial analysis (profitability, discount impact, etc.) can be done correctly.
.This cleaned dataset is ready for visualization and advanced analysis.
